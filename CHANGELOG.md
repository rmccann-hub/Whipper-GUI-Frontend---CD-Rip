# Changelog

All notable changes to Whipper GUI are recorded here. This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Dates are ISO-8601 (YYYY-MM-DD).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **First-run read-offset onboarding.** whipper refuses to rip until a read
  offset is configured; a fresh user (especially one with only CD-Rs, who
  can't run AccurateRip auto-detection) would otherwise hit a cryptic error.
  On first launch, if no offset is set (neither in `whipper.conf` nor as the
  GUI's `--offset` override), the GUI now offers the drive-setup wizard once —
  dismissible, and never re-nagged (afterwards it lives on Tools → Set up
  drive…). The wizard gains a **manual-entry fallback**: when auto-detection
  can't run, enter your drive's published offset by hand (linked to
  AccurateRip's list); it's applied via `--offset`, so `whipper.conf` is never
  hand-authored (KDD-15).

## [0.0.1] — 2026-05-31

**First public test release.** A Linux GUI front-end for the `whipper` CD-ripping
CLI, aiming for EAC-equivalent archival quality. Validated on real Bazzite
hardware: a full 16-track rip *through the published AppImage*, with every
track's Test CRC matching its Copy CRC and "no errors occurred".

### What works

- **End-to-end FLAC ripping** through the host-exported `~/.local/bin/whipper`
  (Distrobox routing), with per-track AccurateRip confidence and Test/Copy CRC
  verification reported in the UI.
- **MusicBrainz disc identification** via a dedicated adapter — whipper's
  interactive TTY prompt never surfaces; a release picker handles multiple
  matches, and unknown discs fall back to editable `Track NN` placeholder rows.
- **Drive setup wizard** (Tools → Set up drive…) runs whipper's own
  `drive analyze` + `offset find` and writes `whipper.conf` for you — no more
  hand-editing read offsets.
- **Drive-access diagnostics** (Tools → Diagnose drive access…) classify the
  "no drive" case and hand you the exact `usermod` fix when it's a permissions
  problem.
- **EAC parity Settings:** cover art (fetch/embed/save), force-overread,
  max-retries, keep-going, CD-R support, and a manual read-offset override.
- **Progress + fidelity UX:** an overall progress bar plus a current-task bar,
  an animated pre-track disc scan, and an end-of-rip fidelity verdict.
- **Single-file AppImage** bundling Python + Qt + dependencies (the GUI side
  needs nothing else installed), plus a `pipx`/source path for developers.

### Install & uninstall

- **`setup-host.sh`** — one command bootstraps the entire host stack (Distrobox
  → `ripping` container → whipper + flac → host export), idempotent, with
  `--dry-run` / `--yes` / `--no-gui`.
- **`uninstall.sh`** — layered, safest-first teardown; never removes ripped
  music or the repo without an explicit flag and a typed confirmation.
- `dev-setup.sh` installs a KDE app-menu entry and a desktop launcher; both are
  cleaned up by `uninstall.sh`.

### Known limitations

- The **host stack is required** — the AppImage cannot rip on its own (this is
  intentional; whipper runs inside Distrobox).
- **FLAC only** in v1 (MP3/WAV are backlog). FLAC compression level is fixed at
  whipper's upstream default (`-5`); see the README for a post-rip re-encode
  recipe if you want `-8`.
- `setup-host.sh` is verified by `--dry-run` and smoke tests; the full
  hardware-bootstrap path has had limited real-world runs.
- Linux x86-64 only.

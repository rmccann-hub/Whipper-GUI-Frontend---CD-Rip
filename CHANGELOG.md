# Changelog

**This is the single, authoritative record of all notable changes to Whipper
GUI** — add an entry to `[Unreleased]` in the *same commit* as any change.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); dates are ISO-8601
(YYYY-MM-DD). The version itself is single-sourced from
`src/whipper_gui/__init__.py` (`__version__`); at release time the `[Unreleased]`
entries move under a dated `## [X.Y.Z]` heading. (Design decisions live in
`PLANNING.md` KDDs and the CLAUDE.md session log — not here.)

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Institutionalized testing strategy + stronger test infrastructure.** New
  [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md) codifies the approach (testing trophy +
  an explicit real-hardware gate, a five-tier case taxonomy, property/golden/
  fault-injection/mutation guidance, the non-negotiable rules, and a Definition
  of Done). Concretely: **property-based tests** (`hypothesis`) lock in the
  "parsers never raise on arbitrary input" invariant
  (`tests/test_parsers_property.py`); CI now runs **branch coverage with a hard
  `--cov-fail-under=88` gate** (baseline ~91%, ratchets up) across a **Python
  3.11–3.13 matrix**; `pytest-cov` + `hypothesis` added to the `dev` extra and
  `mutmut` documented as a periodic audit. Suite is now 534 tests.
- **Ruff linter + formatter.** Adopted `ruff` (config in `pyproject.toml`:
  rules `E,F,W,I,B,UP`, `E501` off; `ruff>=0.15` in the `dev` extra) with a
  parallel `lint` job in CI running `ruff check` + `ruff format --check`. Fixed
  all findings and raised coverage; the suite is now 525 tests.
- **CTDB verify (Phase 1 — library + validation script).** Clean-room (KDD-16)
  CUETools Database lookup client (`adapters/ctdb_client.py`) and verify logic
  (`whipper_gui/ctdb/`), plus a standalone `scripts/ctdb_verify.py` to validate
  on real hardware. The `toc=` wire format and the audio CRC are
  hardware-validation-gated (both fail safe — never a false "verified"); the
  GUI wiring is deferred until they're confirmed. See `docs/test-plan.md`
  Test 1. PCM decode uses the host `flac` if present (optional dependency).
- **Manual / hardware test plan** (`docs/test-plan.md`) — a step-by-step
  checklist for everything that can't be validated in CI (CTDB verify/repair,
  `drive analyze`/`offset find` success strings, GUI screenshot, Picard UX,
  PyPI go-live).
- **Automated PyPI publishing.** A new `.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml`
  builds the wheel + sdist and publishes them to PyPI when a release is
  published (i.e. on every `v*` tag, alongside the AppImage). Uses PyPI
  Trusted Publishing (OIDC) — no stored token. One-time PyPI-side setup is
  documented in the workflow header. It's a separate workflow from
  `release.yml`, so a PyPI misconfiguration can't block the AppImage release.

### Added
- **Read offset is now looked up by drive model (AccurateRip list).** whipper's
  `offset find` is unreliable (it failed on a Pioneer BDR-209D even with a disc
  that's in AccurateRip). The drive-setup wizard now resolves the offset the way
  EAC/dBpoweramp do — by the drive's vendor+model — and pre-fills it for one-click
  save, **with no disc and no whipper probe**. New `adapters/accuraterip_offsets.py`
  (`OffsetDatabase`), extensible via `~/.config/whipper-gui/drive_offsets.csv`;
  whipper's `offset find` is kept as optional verification. The tested Pioneer
  BDR-209D resolves to +667 instantly. See `docs/offset-investigation-2026-06.md`.

### Fixed
- **The app no longer vanishes silently on a startup error.** Drive listing
  (and the rest of startup) ran after the window was shown but outside any
  guard, so an unexpected error — e.g. the drive-list parser choking on
  unhandled whipper output — let the window appear and then immediately
  disappear with nothing logged on screen. Startup is now wrapped: any
  unexpected error (including ones raised inside a Qt slot during the event
  loop, via a `sys.excepthook`) is logged **and shown in a dialog** with the
  log-file path, instead of aborting the process. `DrivePicker.refresh()` also
  now degrades any non-`WhipperError` to an "(error: …)" placeholder so a
  drive-listing hiccup leaves a usable window.
- **Drive-setup wizard:** the manual read-offset spinbox (and its up/down
  arrows) and the **Save offset** button are now locked while detection is
  running, so a value can't be edited/saved mid-detection and race what whipper
  writes. They re-enable when detection finishes.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- **One-command installer (`install.sh`).** A single downloadable file (also a
  release asset) that takes a machine from nothing to a launchable app: sets up
  the host stack (Distrobox + `ripping` container + whipper, via
  `setup-host.sh --no-gui`), downloads the published AppImage, and adds the
  desktop shortcut **plus an "Uninstall Whipper GUI" shortcut**. Flags:
  `--yes`, `--dry-run`, `--no-host`, `--appimage PATH`, `--build`. The
  uninstall shortcut runs the comprehensive `uninstall.sh` (interactive, with
  options); `uninstall.sh` now also removes the AppImage, its icon, and the
  shortcuts, so it cleanly handles both the source and AppImage installs.
- **AppImage built on every push to `main`** (`.github/workflows/appimage.yml`),
  not just at release time, so a broken build recipe is caught immediately. It
  also runs on demand (`workflow_dispatch`) on any branch, uploading a
  downloadable AppImage artifact for testing branches that have no release yet.
  See `docs/appimage-testing.md`.
- **Help menu.** A new **Help → About** dialog shows the version number plus
  support-relevant info (Python/Qt/PySide6 versions, config/log/whipper paths,
  project & issue links), and **Help → User Guide** opens a built-in,
  task-oriented guide (`whipper_gui/help_content.py`).
- **Force-stop for a runaway drive.** Cancelling a rip kills the host-side
  process, but the reader runs inside the `ripping` container and podman
  doesn't forward the signal, so the drive could keep spinning for minutes with
  no way to stop it. Cancel now auto-escalates after a short countdown (and
  there's a manual **Force stop** button): it kills the **whipper orchestrator**
  (which otherwise just respawns the reader), `fuser -k`'s the device, and
  ejects — a deliberate, user-approved exception to the "never call into the
  container" rule, scoped to this case only. Validated on real hardware: Cancel
  now stops the drive within a few seconds.
- **Desktop integration for the AppImage** (`install-appimage.sh`, shipped as
  a release asset): adds an app-menu entry + Desktop icon for a downloaded
  AppImage (which otherwise installs no shortcut), with `--uninstall`.
- **First-run read-offset onboarding.** whipper refuses to rip until a read
  offset is configured; a fresh user (especially one with only CD-Rs, who
  can't run AccurateRip auto-detection) would otherwise hit a cryptic error.
  On first launch, if no offset is set (neither in `whipper.conf` nor as the
  GUI's `--offset` override), the GUI now offers the drive-setup wizard once —
  dismissible, and never re-nagged (afterwards it lives on Tools → Set up
  drive…). The wizard gains a **manual-entry fallback**: when auto-detection
  can't run, enter your drive's published offset by hand (linked to
  AccurateRip's list); it's applied via `--offset`, so `whipper.conf` is never
  hand-authored (KDD-15).

### Fixed
- **CI on `main` was red.** Since the T32 change that auto-creates the output +
  working directories before a rip, the whipper-backend argv tests created
  `/music`, which fails as non-root on the CI runner (it only passed in a
  root dev container). The argv-only tests no longer touch the filesystem; the
  one test that asserts directory creation uses a writable temp path.

## [0.0.1] — 2026-05-31

**First public test release.** A Linux GUI front-end for the `whipper` CD-ripping
CLI, aiming for EAC-equivalent archival quality. Validated on real Bazzite
hardware: a full 16-track rip *through the published AppImage*, with every
track's Test CRC matching its Copy CRC and "no errors occurred".

### What works

- **End-to-end FLAC ripping** through the host-exported `~/.local/bin/whipper`
  (Distrobox routing), with per-track AccurateRip confidence and Test/Copy CRC
  verification reported in the UI.
- **MusicBrainz disc identification** via a dedicated adapter — whipper's
  interactive TTY prompt never surfaces; a release picker handles multiple
  matches, and unknown discs fall back to editable `Track NN` placeholder rows.
- **Drive setup wizard** (Tools → Set up drive…) runs whipper's own
  `drive analyze` + `offset find` and writes `whipper.conf` for you — no more
  hand-editing read offsets.
- **Drive-access diagnostics** (Tools → Diagnose drive access…) classify the
  "no drive" case and hand you the exact `usermod` fix when it's a permissions
  problem.
- **EAC parity Settings:** cover art (fetch/embed/save), force-overread,
  max-retries, keep-going, CD-R support, and a manual read-offset override.
- **Progress + fidelity UX:** an overall progress bar plus a current-task bar,
  an animated pre-track disc scan, and an end-of-rip fidelity verdict.
- **Single-file AppImage** bundling Python + Qt + dependencies (the GUI side
  needs nothing else installed), plus a `pipx`/source path for developers.

### Install & uninstall

- **`setup-host.sh`** — one command bootstraps the entire host stack (Distrobox
  → `ripping` container → whipper + flac → host export), idempotent, with
  `--dry-run` / `--yes` / `--no-gui`.
- **`uninstall.sh`** — layered, safest-first teardown; never removes ripped
  music or the repo without an explicit flag and a typed confirmation.
- `dev-setup.sh` installs a KDE app-menu entry and a desktop launcher; both are
  cleaned up by `uninstall.sh`.

### Known limitations

- The **host stack is required** — the AppImage cannot rip on its own (this is
  intentional; whipper runs inside Distrobox).
- **FLAC only** in v1 (MP3/WAV are backlog). FLAC compression level is fixed at
  whipper's upstream default (`-5`); see the README for a post-rip re-encode
  recipe if you want `-8`.
- `setup-host.sh` is verified by `--dry-run` and smoke tests; the full
  hardware-bootstrap path has had limited real-world runs.
- Linux x86-64 only.

## 0. Why this exists

The maintainer asked (2026-06-23) to not rule out, long-term, forking and/or
combining whipper and cyanrip — fixing, updating, and upgrading them ourselves
to get exactly the behaviour we need — **within what their licenses allow**.

Today we invoke the rippers as **subprocess adapters** (Critical Rule #3, KDD-18),
and the `WhipperBackend` ABC + `Config.ripper_backend` mean the engine is already
swappable as a near one-file change. So we can keep this option fully open at
**zero cost** while we finish the GUI: the decision is deferred, not foreclosed.

## 1. The two engines (facts, with sources)

**whipper** — [`whipper-team/whipper`](https://github.com/whipper-team/whipper)
- License: **GNU GPL-3.0** (copyright 2009–2021). Python 3 (3.6+), derived from `morituri`.
- Releases: last tagged release **v0.10.0, 2021-05-17** (KDD-18); the `develop`
  branch still receives commits (~1,600+), but no new *release* in years.
- Architecture: orchestrates `cdparanoia`/`cd-paranoia` (secure read), `cdrdao`
  (gap detection), `flac`, and `libdiscid` as subprocesses; writes an EAC-grade
  YAML rip log (KDD-11).
- Known liabilities we'd inherit on a fork: the **`pkg_resources`/Python-3.14
  setuptools≥81 cliff** (DEPENDENCIES.md), and the **cd-paranoia >587-sample
  read-offset bug** that failed tracks on the Pioneer BDR-209D (+667) (KDD-18).

**cyanrip** — [`cyanreg/cyanrip`](https://github.com/cyanreg/cyanrip)
- License: **GNU LGPL-2.1** (`LICENSE.md`). C (~99%) + Meson build.
- Releases: latest **v0.9.3.1, 2024-06-05**; actively developed (8 releases).
- Architecture: read + offset compensation + error recovery via
  **libcdio-paranoia**; encode/mux via **FFmpeg ≥4.0** → 11 formats
  (flac, mp3, opus, aac, wavpack, alac, vorbis, tta, wav, alac/aac/opus-in-mp4,
  pcm). Built-in **AccurateRip v1/v2 + EAC CRC32 + MusicBrainz + ReplayGain**.
  Applies the read offset with its own paranoia (no >587 bug).
- Build deps: FFmpeg (libav*), libcdio-paranoia, libmusicbrainz5, libcurl.

## 2. Licensing — what we may legally do (the gating question, answered)

**Our project is GPL-3.0-only** (KDD-10). Verdict: **licensing is not a blocker
for forking or combining either tool.** The real costs are maintenance and
engineering, not legal.

| Tool | Its license | If we fork/embed into our GPL-3.0 code |
|---|---|---|
| whipper | GPL-3.0-only | Directly compatible — same license; the combined work stays GPL-3.0. ✓ |
| cyanrip | LGPL-2.1 | LGPL-2.1 **explicitly permits relicensing to GPL-2-or-later**, hence GPL-3.0; combining LGPL-2.1 with GPL-3 yields a GPL-3 work. ✓ (LGPL is also the *more permissive* base — more downstream freedom.) |

- **cyanrip's transitive deps:** FFmpeg is LGPL-2.1+ by default (GPL only with
  `--enable-gpl`); **libcdio-paranoia is GPL-3.0-only**; libcdio is mixed
  (GPL-2+/GPL-3+/LGPL-2.1). Because cyanrip already links GPL-3.0
  libcdio-paranoia, a *distributed cyanrip binary is already effectively GPL-3.0*
  — consistent with us.
- **Obligations a fork/embed adds** (today's subprocess model keeps their licenses
  out of our code per KDD-10): ship complete corresponding **source** (we already
  do — public repo), keep it **GPL-3.0**, retain all copyright + license headers,
  **state our modifications**, add **no further restrictions**, never relicense
  proprietary. The clean-room rule (KDD-16) still bars copying anything
  **GPL-2.0-*only*** (one-way-incompatible) into our GPL-3.0 work.

## 3. The strategic options (menu, with trade-offs)

- **Option 0 — Status quo + upstream contribution (KDD-18 default).** Keep the
  subprocess adapters; when a ripper-level change is needed, contribute it to
  **cyanrip** (active). *Lowest burden; depends on upstream accepting + releasing.*
- **Option 1 — Fork whipper.** *Pros:* Python (our language); EAC-grade log +
  cdrdao gap detection. *Cons:* stalled releases, the `pkg_resources`/Python-3.14
  cliff we'd own, the >587 bug, morituri legacy. **High maintenance.**
- **Option 2 — Fork cyanrip.** *Pros:* active, C/FFmpeg (no Python cliff),
  already does AccurateRip+EAC-CRC+MB+ReplayGain+11 formats, LGPL→GPL3 trivial,
  applies offset without the >587 bug. *Cons:* C (not our primary language);
  Meson/FFmpeg/libcdio build + packaging to own; dep/ABI churn.
- **Option 3 — Combine.** Use **cyanrip as the engine** and port whipper's
  EAC-parity log (and any gap-detection edge) onto it → one GPL-3.0 engine we
  control. *Highest power, highest effort.*
- **Option 4 — Build our own ripper.** Rejected historically (KDD-08/18): the
  forensic read/offset/AccurateRip math is exactly what we delegate to a trusted
  tool. **Keep rejected.**

**Preliminary lean (NOT a decision):** if we ever fork, **cyanrip is the stronger
base** (active, no Python cliff, broad format support, permissive license, no >587
bug) — which also matches KDD-18's "migrate the adapter to cyanrip if forced." The
sane escalation ladder: **Option 0 first** (upstream a specific need); escalate to
**Option 2/3** only if upstream can't/won't *and* the maintenance cost is justified.

## 4. Why deferring is free (the architectural safety net)

The `WhipperBackend` ABC + `Config.ripper_backend` already isolate the engine
(KDD-08/18). A fork would be **a new adapter implementation + a host-setup install
step** — not a GUI rewrite. So the maintainer's sequencing ("after we make the
rest work") costs nothing: maintaining adapter discipline *is* what keeps the
fork/combine option open.

## 5. Decision gates before adopting any fork/combine

1. v1 feature set complete **and** hardware parity proven (the
   `output_reference/` EAC output-parity matrix passing for whipper **and** cyanrip).
2. A concrete need upstream won't serve, **documented**.
3. Maintenance capacity assessed: who builds/releases the fork; CI for a C/Meson
   (or Python) build; ongoing security updates for FFmpeg/libcdio.
4. An explicit **KDD amending KDD-18**.

## 6. Open research tasks (append findings here as we learn)

- [ ] Gauge cyanrip upstream's PR responsiveness (issue/PR turnaround) — gates Option 0.
- [ ] Inventory exactly what whipper does that cyanrip doesn't (gap-detection
      method, log fields, `.cue`/`.toc` output) — gates Option 3.
- [ ] Map cyanrip's FFmpeg flag surface for what we want (FLAC compression level,
      encode verify, richer tags) — a rich-enough flag surface could make a fork
      unnecessary.
- [ ] Prototype: build cyanrip from source inside our `ripping` container; measure
      the build/packaging burden.
- [ ] Re-verify transitive-dep licenses at the exact versions we'd ship
      (FFmpeg build flags; libcdio components).
- [ ] Re-confirm whipper's Python-3.14 / `pkg_resources` status at decision time.
